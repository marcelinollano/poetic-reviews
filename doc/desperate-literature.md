documentSentiment contains the overall sentiment of the document, which consists of the following fields:

- score of the sentiment ranges between -1.0 (negative) and 1.0 (positive) and corresponds to the overall emotional leaning of the text.

- magnitude indicates the overall strength of emotion (both positive and negative) within the given text, between 0.0 and +inf. Unlike score, magnitude is not normalized; each expression of emotion within the text (both positive and negative) contributes to the text's magnitude (so longer text blocks may have greater magnitudes).
